💭Reflection Question💭
-Why is there an additional Security tab in the properties window of documents stored on an NTFS volume?
👉#Answer: Because NTFS supports permissions and security per file/folder (ACLs), you can define which users can read, write, modify, or execute, as well as manage ownership and auditing. In FAT32, this doesn’t exist, which is why that tab doesn’t appear.
