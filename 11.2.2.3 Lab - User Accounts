💥Here im gonna begging with the questions of my eighth lab💥.

⭐Part 2: Change the Account Type.

❔Question:

-What is the advantage of having most users work within a Standard user account?

👉#Answer:

The advantage of using a Standard user account is improved system security. Standard users cannot install software, change system-wide settings, or make critical changes without administrator approval. This helps prevent accidental system damage and reduces the risk of malware or unauthorized changes.

⭐Part 3: Delete the Account.

❔Question:

-For this lab, select Delete Files. What are the other options? When would you choose the other options?

👉#Answer:

The other option is Keep Files.

You would choose Keep Files when you want to remove a user account but preserve the user’s personal data, such as documents or desktop files, for backup, transfer to another user, or future reference.

Delete Files is chosen when the user no longer needs access and their data is no longer required.

💭Reflection Questions💭

❔Question 1:

-Why is it important to protect all accounts with strong passwords?

👉#Answer:

Strong passwords help prevent unauthorized access to user accounts, protect personal and sensitive data, and reduce the risk of security breaches, identity theft, and malware infections. 

❔Question 2:

-Why would you create a user with Standard privileges?

👉#Answer:

A Standard user account is created to limit the user’s ability to make system-level changes, improving security and system stability while still allowing normal daily tasks such as using applications and accessing files. 

❔Question 3:

-In what type of situation would an IT administrator delete a user account and choose to keep the files of that user account instead of deleting them?

👉#Answer:

An IT administrator would keep the files when an employee leaves an organization but their work documents need to be reviewed, archived, or transferred to another employee or department.
