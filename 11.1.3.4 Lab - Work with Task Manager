-How many Apps, Background processes, and Windows processes (i.e Processes) are currently running? 
👉#Answer: Apps: 4

Background processes: 78

Windows processes: 52
-What is the total physical memory (MB)?
👉#Answer: Total: 4096 MB.
-What is the available physical memory (MB)? 
👉#Answer: Available: 1740.8 MB.
-How much physical memory (MB) is being used by the computer? 
👉#Answer: In use: 2355 MB.
-What is the link speed? What type of Ethernet Adapter is in use on this computer? 
👉#Answer: 64 Kbps. It is an Ethernet network adapter.

👉#Answer: 10.0.2.15

⭐Part 4: Processes tab. 
❔Questions:
-What effect does this have on the columns? 
👉#Answer: Sort the list by memory usage, and pressing again reverses the order (highest→lowest / lowest→highest).
-What affect does this have on the Memory column? 
👉#Answer: The Memory column changes from displaying values (MB/GB) to showing usage percentages.
-How could this be useful? 
👉#Answer: Allows you to quickly compare which processes consume the largest proportion of RAM, without relying on the total memory size of the computer.

-List the available options
👉#Answer: End task, End process tree, Provide Feedback, Efficiency mode, Set priority, Set affinity, Analyze wait chain, UAC virtualization, Create memory dump file, Open file location, Search online, Properties and Go to Service(s).

💭Reflection Question💭
-Why is it important for an administrator to understand how to work within the Task Manager? 
👉#Answer: Because it allows monitoring performance (CPU/RAM/network), identifying bottlenecks, detecting processes that consume resources abnormally, terminating frozen applications or processes, checking services and their status, and analyzing what runs at startup. This helps to resolve issues, improve stability, and keep the system under control.
