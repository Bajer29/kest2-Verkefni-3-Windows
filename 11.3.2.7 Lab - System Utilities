💥Here im gonna begging with the questions of my Lab 12 – System Utilities💥.

⭐ Part 1: Custom Management Console.
❔Question:

-What was the path you use to navigate to the Event Viewer?

👉#Answer:
Management Tools > Computer Management > System Tools > Event Viewer.

⭐ Part 2: Registry Editor
Step 1: Change your desktop background settings.
❔Question

-What is the background picture?

👉#Answer:
A windows default wallpaper.

Step 2: Open the registry editor.
❔Question:

-What is the data value of the Background (hint – it has three numbers that correspond to red, green, and blue)?

👉#Answer:
The data value of Background is a set of three numbers representing RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values.

For a blue background, the value is typically something like 0 0 255 (values may vary slightly depending on the shade).

Step 3: Export a registry key.
❔Question:

-What is the data value of the Background? (from BlueBKG.reg)

👉#Answer:
The data value of Background in the exported file matches the blue RGB value, such as 0 0 255.

❔Question:

-What is the data value of the Background? Compare the new value in the Registry to the value saved in BlueBKG.reg.

👉#Answer:

What to do (step by step):

Right-click the Desktop > Personalize.

Change the background color to red.

Return to Registry Editor and press F5 to refresh.

Check the Background value again.

Answer:

After changing the background to red, the Background value changes to a red RGB value, such as 232 17 35.

This value is different from the one stored in BlueBKG.reg, which contains the blue RGB values.

Step 4: Import a registry file.
❔Question:

-What is the data value of the Background?
What is the color of the desktop?

👉#Answer:
The Background value returns to the blue RGB value (for example, 0 0 255).

The desktop color changes back to blue.

❔Question:

-What is the color of the desktop? (after restart)

👉#Answer:
After restarting the computer, the desktop color is blue, confirming that the registry change was applied permanently.

⭐ Reflection Questions
❔Question 1:

-Why would it be beneficial to add snap-ins to the mmc that are for other computers on the network?

👉#Answer:

It allows administrators to manage and monitor multiple computers remotely from a single console, improving efficiency and reducing the need for physical access to each system.

❔Question 2:

-After restarting the computer, why was the desktop color changed?

👉#Answer:

The desktop color changed because the registry settings were modified, and these settings are applied during system startup, making the change persistent after a restart.
