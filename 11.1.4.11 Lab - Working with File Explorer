💥Here im gonna begging with the questions of my Lab 6 – Working with File Explorer💥.

⭐Part 1: Explore File Explorer 
❔Questions:

-What happened with Folder1 and Folder2 on the Desktop?

👉#Answer: When Folder2 is moved inside Folder1, Folder2 no longer appears separately on the Desktop. It becomes a subfolder inside Folder1, so only Folder1 is visible on the Desktop, and Folder2 is found inside it.

-What is the file extension for the text document?

👉#Answer: The file extension is .txt.

-How would you do it? (Make a copy of the text document and place it in Folder2.)

👉#Answer: Right-click the text file and select Copy, open Folder2, then right-click and select Paste.

Alternatively, use Ctrl + C to copy and Ctrl + V to paste.

You can also drag the file into Folder2 while holding Ctrl to copy it.

-What are the attributes associated with this file? (Properties > Details tab)

👉#Answer: Name: Text document txt, Type: Text Document, File location: C:\Users\vboxuser\Desktop\Folder1\Folder2, Size: 0 bytes, Date created: 1/26/2026 3:26PM, Date modified: 1/26/2026 3:20PM, Attributes: A, Owner: WINDOWS\vboxuser, Computer: WINDOWS (thisPC). 

-What is the complete path to Folder3?

👉#Answer: C:\Users\vboxuser\Desktop\Folder1\Folder2\Folder3

-Which directories are listed under Quick access?

👉#Answer: Desktop, Downloads, Documents, Pictures, Music, Videos and Folder1.

-What happened? Why would you want to do this? (Drag Folder1 to Quick access)

👉#Answer:Folder1 becomes pinned to Quick access. The folder is not moved or duplicated; only a shortcut is created.

This is useful because it allows faster access to Folder1 without navigating through the Desktop each time.

-What are folders listed in the Local Disk (C:)?

👉#Answer: inetpub, PerdLogs, Program Files, Program Files (x86), Users Windows, Windows.old, vboxpostinstall.log .

-Open the Users folder. List all the folders in the directory.

👉#Answer: Public and vboxuser.

-Were you able to open it? Explain. (your username folder)

👉#Answer: Yes, I was able to open it because my user account has permission to access its own user directory.

-Were you able to open it? Explain. (another username folder)

👉#Answer: I could open it because i have read permissions.

-Open the Public folder. List all the folders in the directory.

👉#Answer: Public Documents, Public Downloads, Public Music, Public Pictures and Public Videos.

⭐Part 2: Windows Libraries, Step 2: Access Libraries in Windows 11:

❔Question:

-Which folders or files listed under the Libraries heading?

👉#Answer: Documents, Pictures, Music, Videos.

-How would you remove the directory of Folder1 from the library without deleting Folder1 and its contents from the computer?

👉#Answer: To remove Folder1 from the library without deleting it from the computer, right-click the library and select Properties.

In the list of included locations, select Folder1 and click Remove.

Then click OK to apply the changes.

This action only removes Folder1 from the library view and does not delete the actual folder or its contents from the Desktop.
