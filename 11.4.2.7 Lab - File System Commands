This deletes all files in the current directory (but not folders). 

⭐ Part 5: Use the xcopy and robocopy commands.
❔Question:

👉#Answer:
The option is /E, which copies all subdirectories, including empty ones. 

⭐ Part 6: Delete directories.
❔Question:

No, the directory could not be deleted because it was not empty.

The rd command without switches only deletes empty directories.
