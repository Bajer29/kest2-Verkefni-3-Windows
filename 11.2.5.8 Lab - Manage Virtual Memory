💭Reflection Questions💭

-Why would you ever change the default virtual memory page file settings in Windows?

👉#Answer:

Changing the default virtual memory page file settings can be useful in situations where:

More storage space is required for the paging file on another partition (e.g., if C: is running out of space).

You want to improve performance by manually setting the size of the paging file.

The system is running low on memory and you need to adjust virtual memory settings to prevent crashes or errors.

Multiple partitions are present, and you want to store the paging file on a specific drive for performance reasons.
